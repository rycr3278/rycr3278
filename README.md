## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a creative and detail-oriented professional, transitioning from a successful career in digital video editing into the fascinating world of computer science.

When I'm not working on some code, you might find me immersed in a good book, playing with my dog, or hiking the trails around NJ.
